# McHenry_Election_Data
A program to enable analysis of general election, precinct-level data from 2014-2018 in McHenry County Illinois.

Election data is from the Illinois Board of Elections website (https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionResults.aspx?ID=J4oBCk7Y04s%3d) and was downloaded as .csv files.  

To use, download the following files:
  Final Project-Election Results.py
  McHENRY2014GE.csv
  McHENRY2016GE.csv
  McHENRY2018GE.csv
  McHenry_County_Precinct_Names.txt

The program will output a csv file for each McHenry County Precinct (212) for each of the three election files.
